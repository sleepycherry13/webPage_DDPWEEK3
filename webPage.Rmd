## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```library(leaflet)

# Coordinates for India's approximate boundaries (a simplified polygon outline)
india_boundary <- list(
  c(35.5087, 77.8374), c(34.3219, 78.9123), c(32.9944, 78.4579), c(30.8827, 77.9796), 
  c(29.4524, 77.8374), c(28.912, 78.962), c(27.212, 78.980), c(24.217, 77.1027), 
  c(22.795, 76.8725), c(21.504, 76.4085), c(19.8079, 76.2314), c(18.4861, 76.0513), 
  c(16.1661, 76.0294), c(15.1431, 73.8477), c(13.7656, 73.9934), c(12.5035, 74.1593),
  c(10.9947, 76.0114), c(9.8139, 77.5396), c(8.8016, 77.9415), c(8.135, 79.0063),
  c(12.593, 80.319), c(20.2437, 88.2464), c(26.0086, 92.0959), c(28.0041, 97.3271), 
  c(35.5087, 77.8374) # loop back to start
)

# Add some major cities with markers
city_coords <- data.frame(
  city = c("New Delhi", "Mumbai", "Bangalore", "Kolkata", "Hyderabad", "Chennai"),
  lat = c(28.6139, 19.0760, 12.9716, 22.5726, 17.3850, 13.0827),
  lng = c(77.2090, 72.8777, 77.5946, 88.3639, 78.4867, 80.2707)
)

# Create Leaflet map
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(lng = sapply(india_boundary, `[[`, 2), 
              lat = sapply(india_boundary, `[[`, 1), 
              color = "blue", 
              weight = 2, 
              opacity = 0.6,
              fillOpacity = 0.1,
              popup = "Approximate Boundary of India") %>%
  addMarkers(data = city_coords, 
             ~lng, ~lat, 
             popup = ~city)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
